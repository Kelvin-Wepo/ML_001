# Voice-Activated Assistant with gTTS and Speech Recognition

This Python code creates a voice-activated assistant that uses Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for speech synthesis and the SpeechRecognition library to recognize voice commands. The assistant can perform tasks such as greeting users, booking appointments, and responding to inquiries.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/): Google Text-to-Speech library for converting text to speech.
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/): Library for recognizing speech from audio input.
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html): Library for interacting with the operating system.
- [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html): Library for working with dates and times.

To install the required libraries, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install gTTS SpeechRecognition
```

## Usage

1. The code starts by defining functions for voice synthesis and recognition using gTTS and SpeechRecognition.

2. The `wish_me()` function greets the user based on the current time and introduces the assistant.

3. The `take_command()` function uses a microphone to capture voice input and recognizes user commands.

4. The code then enters a loop to continuously listen for user input.

5. The assistant responds to specific voice commands. For example:
   - When the user says "hello," the assistant introduces itself and offers assistance.
   - When the user wants to book an appointment, the assistant asks for the department.
   - When the user selects the "optical" department, the assistant asks for the user's name and provides available appointment times.
   - The assistant books the appointment for the selected time.
   - The assistant responds to other queries accordingly.

## Running the Code

1. Ensure that you have the required libraries installed, as mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.

2. Run the code, and it will initiate the voice-activated assistant.

3. Follow the assistant's prompts and voice commands to interact with it.

4. The assistant uses gTTS to respond with synthesized speech, and it listens for your voice commands using SpeechRecognition.

5. You can adjust and expand the functionality of the assistant by adding more voice commands and responses.

## Note

- The code uses `mpg321` to play the generated audio. You might need to install `mpg321` if it's not already available on your system.

- The code is designed to work on Linux systems. If you are using a different operating system, you may need to make adjustments.

- Remember to use the code responsibly and respect privacy and security considerations when working with voice-activated systems.
